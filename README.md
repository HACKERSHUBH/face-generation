Using deep learning DCGAN neural network to generate realistic faces from celebrity images.

# DCGAN in Tensorflow

Tensorflow implementation of [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) which is a stabilize Generative Adversarial Networks. The referenced torch code can be found [here](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch).
